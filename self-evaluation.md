# Self-Evaluation

## Name(s): 

Out of 20 points. Use output.txt created using 
`./create-output.sh > output.txt 2>&1` for guidance.

Complete all questions with "Q:"

Q: Does the program compile and run to completion: Yes/No

- If the program does not compile or gives a segmentation error when run, 
the maximum possible grade is 50%. No need to continue with the rest of self-evaluation

Q: All public functions have been implemented: ENTER_NUMBER

- -1 for each public function not implemented
- Constructors:  BSTMap(), BSTMap(const BSTMap &bst); BSTMap(const vector<value_type> &v);
- Destructor: ~BSTMap
- Equality: operator==, operator!=
- Traversal: inorder, preorder, postorder
- Rebalancing: rebalance
- Helpers: empty, size, height, clear, contains, count
- Accessor/Modifiers: operator[], getAll

Q: Bonus function - erase: ENTER_NUMBER

- +1 if erase has been successfully implemented

Q: -1 for each compilation warning, min -3: ENTER_NUMBER

- Check under *1. Compiles without warnings*
- If the warning message is addressed in README.md, including how the programmer tried to address it, no deductions

Q: -1 for each clang-tidy warning, min -3: ENTER_NUMBER

- Check under *3. clang-tidy warnings*
- If the warning message is addressed in README.md, including how the programmer tried to address it, no deductions

Q: -1 for each clang-format warning, min -3: ENTER_NUMBER

- Check under *4. clang-format does not find any formatting issues*

Q: Runs and produces correct output: ENTER_NUMBER

- Try running "./a.out cities.txt Sea" and other examples
- -2 if the output is not sorted by weight

Q: -2 for any detected memory leak: ENTER_NUMBER

- Check under *5. No memory leaks using g++*
- Check under *6. No memory leaks using valgrind*

Q: Do the tests sufficiently test the code: ENTER_NUMBER

- -1 for each large block of code not executed
- -2 for each function that is never called when testing
- Check under *7. Tests have full code coverage* paying attention to *The lines below were never executed*

Q: Are all functions in .h and .cpp file documents (min -3): ENTER_NUMBER

- -1 for each function not documented

Q: Total points: ENTER_NUMBER
